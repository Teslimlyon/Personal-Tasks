ðŸŽ¨ RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

RGB is a color model used in computers, screens, and digital graphics.

Every color is represented as a mix of Red, Green, and Blue light.

Each component (R, G, B) is an integer between 0 and 255.

0 means no light of that color.

255 means full intensity of that color.



âœ… Example:

(255, 0, 0) = pure Red

(0, 255, 0) = pure Green

(0, 0, 255) = pure Blue

(255, 255, 255) = White (all colors full)

(0, 0, 0) = Black (no color)

ðŸ”¢ Hexadecimal (Hex) Color Codes

Hex is another way of writing colors, mostly used in HTML/CSS for web design.

Instead of (R, G, B), you write a 6-digit hexadecimal number:

Two digits for Red

Two digits for Green

Two digits for Blue


Values go from 00 (0 in decimal) to FF (255 in decimal).


âœ… Example:

(255, 0, 0) â†’ #FF0000 (Red)

(0, 255, 0) â†’ #00FF00 (Green)

(0, 0, 255) â†’ #0000FF (Blue)

(255, 255, 255) â†’ #FFFFFF (White)

(0, 0, 0) â†’ #000000 (Black)

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

RGB: easy for humans ((R,G,B) with numbers).

Hex: compact for computers/web (#RRGGBB).
