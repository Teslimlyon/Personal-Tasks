🎨 RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

RGB is a color model used in computers, screens, and digital graphics.

Every color is represented as a mix of Red, Green, and Blue light.

Each component (R, G, B) is an integer between 0 and 255.

0 means no light of that color.

255 means full intensity of that color.



✅ Example:

(255, 0, 0) = pure Red

(0, 255, 0) = pure Green

(0, 0, 255) = pure Blue

(255, 255, 255) = White (all colors full)

(0, 0, 0) = Black (no color)

🔢 Hexadecimal (Hex) Color Codes

Hex is another way of writing colors, mostly used in HTML/CSS for web design.

Instead of (R, G, B), you write a 6-digit hexadecimal number:

Two digits for Red

Two digits for Green

Two digits for Blue


Values go from 00 (0 in decimal) to FF (255 in decimal).


✅ Example:

(255, 0, 0) → #FF0000 (Red)

(0, 255, 0) → #00FF00 (Green)

(0, 0, 255) → #0000FF (Blue)

(255, 255, 255) → #FFFFFF (White)

(0, 0, 0) → #000000 (Black)

👉 In short:

RGB: easy for humans ((R,G,B) with numbers).

Hex: compact for computers/web (#RRGGBB)
.


Meaning of "%02X"

1. % → says: “I’m going to format a value here”.


2. 0 → means: “pad with zeros if the number is shorter”.


3. 2 → means: “make the width at least 2 characters”.


4. X → means: “print the number in hexadecimal, with uppercase letters”.

✅ Examples

import Text.Printf (printf)

main = do
  printf "%02X\n" (5 :: Int)     -- "05"
  printf "%02X\n" (15 :: Int)    -- "0F"
  printf "%02X\n" (255 :: Int)   -- "FF"

5 → "05" (two characters, padded with 0)

15 → "0F" (hex for 15 is F, but padded to 2 chars)

255 → "FF"

🔎 Why it’s useful in RGB → Hex

Since each color component must always be two digits in hex:

Red 0 → "00"

Green 255 → "FF"

Blue 64 → "40"


That’s why we use "%02X" — it guarantees each piece is exactly two hex digits, even if it’s less than 16.
